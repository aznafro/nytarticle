# NYT Article

Remaking a NYT Article was an assignment on The Odin Project. This assignment had us useing flexbox and grid. Although I didn't find much use for grid in this assignment, flexbox proved to be very powerful and useful alternative to floats and centering children elements in some of the sections on this page.

My re-make can be found [here](https://aznafro.github.io/nytarticle/).
